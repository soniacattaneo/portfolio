                UNDO is a typeface system designed to
                integrate Braille
                with different alphabets.
                It is distinguished by its
                ability to adapt to
                the rigid grid of Braille,
                harmonizing
                characters belonging to heterogeneous
                writing systems. The result is a
                monospaced, sans serif, low-contrast
                font that aims to be highly legible.

               Despite its widespread use, there is
                currently no font that integrates Braille
                with other scripts. This gap highlights
                the need for new typographic solutions
                that can bridge different alphabets and
                tactile reading systems, fostering

               UNDO integrates Braille and visual alphabets on two levels: physical, 
               by bringing writing systems usually kept separate into the same 
               typographic space, and human, by promoting inclusion and equality
              between sighted and blind people. Additionally, this coexistence has an 
              educational role, supporting the learning of Braille also for sighted readers.

               Each script was selected to demonstrate
              the flexibility of the system: starting with
              Braille,
              consisting of dots, the font take
              shape based
              on Latin, the dominant
              script characterized by both
              sinuous and
              squarish shapes; on Greek, a
              script with ancient historical origins; on Cyrillic, with its
              complex, angular characters; and finally on Arebica,
              the Arabic
              script adapted to phonetic
              system of Croatian language,
              it was used
